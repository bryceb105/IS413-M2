<h2>What do I hope to get out of IS 413</h2>

<p>
    I am not 100% sure what to expect from IS 413.  But most of all I hope to broaden my skills at creating impactful and dynamic websites.
    I hope to be able to learn all that I can outside of the classroom so that I can maximize all that is possible while I am in the classroomn.
    This is going to be a great semster
